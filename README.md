# LPG-GAS-LEAKAGE-DETECTOR-USING-8051-Microcontroller
The main objective of this project report is to deal with the design and testing of LPG leakage detector with the 8051 series of ATMELâ€™s microcontrollers. The project uses the 8051 variant AT89S52(8051).The program for configuring the microcontroller was written in Keil microvision3IDE, designed for ATMEL 8051 series microcontrollers.
